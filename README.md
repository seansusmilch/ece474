# ðŸ’» ECE 474 Project

The goal of this project is to write a simulator for Tomasulo's algorithm.

## Project Board

In the project board thing we can track work that needs to be done and the work that we're doing.

* Add stuff that needs to be done to **ToDo**
* Move stuff we're working on to **In progress**
  * We each have our own In progress column
* Move finished work to **Done**
